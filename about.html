                <br>
                <p>Bryson was born and raised in Ireland, Wexford. After travelling the globe post college (diploma in
                    Photography Art), he found his true passion: Boudoir. He has been empowering women for the last 12
                    years, giving them a
                    chance to understand just how beautiful they are.

                <br>
                <p>Anda was nominated top-tier make up artist last year in her hometown of Johannesburg. She came to Ireland
                    for a holiday where she met Bryson and the rest is as how they say, history. Their partnership is based
                    on
                    mutual respect and love towards the Boudoir art and what it represents.

                <p>Minoa comes as the last (but not the least) addition to the team from Sydney, Australia. Her experience
                    working on movie sets
                    translated well to Boudoir. She can apply her knowledge of subtle make-up, just enough,
                    not to cover and hide but to bring forward your natural beauty.

                    <div>
                        We have many packages suited for different budgets. We can do a small and short photo shoot (starting
                        at Eur 200) to almost
                        full-day experience in one of our hotel partners (up to Eur 1000). The best thing is to get in <a
                            href="#form" aria-label="Click here to go to the contact section">contact</a> with
                        us so we can discuss everything!

                    </summary>
                    <div>
                        Join the crowd! All of the women we take through the Boudoir Experience think they cannot amount to
                        the "beautiful" standard.
                        The goal of the experience is to prove to you that you are beautiful, unique and special
                        <strong>because</strong> of who you are.
                        At the end of the experience it is our promise you will feel like a model!

                    <div>
                        Privacy is something we take very seriously. At the start of the photo shoot we will provide you with
                        a document/contract where you will be able
                        to choose if the pictures are for your eyes only (or for someone special), or can they be used in
                        our website.
                        Most women are so satisfied that they want the world to see the images!

                    <summary title="Click here to reveal answer">Do you only shoot in your studio?</summary>
                    <div>
                        No! We are flexible in terms of shoot location. Our studio is set up so there is a lot of natural
                        light coming in and the furniture and decor is minimalistic.
                        But we have also partnered with some of the hotels in Wexford area so we can shoot in their rooms,
                        or better yet, absolutely exquisite

                        Suites!</a>
                        There is also an option of outside shoot (rain, temperature and sunshine dependant).

                <details>
                    <summary title="Click here to reveal answer">Can I bring someone to the shoot?</summary>
                    <div>
                        Absolutely! Having your friends or loved ones see you in a different light will go a long way to
                        boost your confidence. The only thing we wouldn't recommend is bringing your children - that
                        is always a bit awkward. And if the kids are younger, it leads to a lot of giggles!

                    </summary>
                    <div>
                        Some women actually prefer male photographer, but we understand if you feel uneasy.
                        What we can promise if relaxed and fun environment (there's chocolate and sparkling wine).
                        Bryson (our photographer) is very professional and knows how to direct posing with ease.
                        The choice of clothing, amount of make-up (we recommend minimal) are entirely up to you!
