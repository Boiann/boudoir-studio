            <h2>Photographer</h2>
            <img src="/assets/images/team_images/photographer.jpg" alt="#">
            <br>
            <p>Bryson was born and raised in Ireland, Wexford. After travelling the globe post college (diploma in
                Photography Art), he found his true passion: Boudoir. He has been empowering women for the last 12
                years, giving them a
                chance to understand just how beautiful they are.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Anda was nominated top-tier make up artist last year in her hometown of Johannesburg. She came to Ireland
                for a holiday where she met Bryson and the rest is as how they say, history. Their partnership is based
                on
                mutual respect and love towards the Boudoir art and what it represents.

            <br>
            <p>Minoa comes as the last (but not the least) addition to the team from Sydney, Australia. Her experience
                working on movie sets
                translated well to Boudoir. She can apply her knowledge of subtle make-up, just enough,
                not to cover and hide but to bring forward your natural beauty.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <details>
                <summary>Is Boudoir Photograpy Expensive?</summary>
                <div>
                    We have many packages suited for different budgets. We can do a small and short photoshoot (starting
                    at Eur 200) to almost
                    full-day experience in one of our hotel partners (up to Eur 1000). The best thing is to get in <a
                        href="#form">contact</a> with
                    us so we can discuss everything!
                </div>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I'm not confident in my looks? I'm no model...</summary>
                <div>
                    Join the crowd! All of the women we take through the Boudoir Experience think they cannot amount to
                    the "beautiful" standard.
                    The goal of the experience is to prove to you that you are beautiful, unique and special
                    <strong>because</strong> of who you are.
                    At the end of the experience it is our promise you will feel like a model!

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will other people be able to see my pictures?</summary>
                <div>
                    Privacy is something we take very seriously. At the start of the photoshoot we will provide you with
                    a document/contract where you will be able
                    to choose if the pictures are for your eyes only (or for someone special), or can they be used in
                    our website.
                    Most women are so satisfied that they want the world to see the images!

            <details>
                <summary>Do you only shoot in your studio?</summary>
                <div>
                    No! We are flexible in terms of shoot location. Our studio is set up so there is a lot of natural
                    light coming in and the furniture is minimalistic.
                    But we have also partnered with some of the hotels in Wexford area so we can shoot in their rooms,
                    or better yet, absolutely exquisite
                    <a href="https://www.riversideparkhotel.com/room/penthouse-suite/">Penthouse Suites!</a>
                    There is also an option of outside shoot (rain, temperature and sunshine dependant).

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I bring someone to the shoot?</summary>
                <div>
                    Absolutely! Having your friends or loved ones see you in a different light will go a long way to
                    boost your confidence. The only thing we wouldn't reccomend is bringing your children - that
                    is always a bit awkward. And if the kids are younger, it leads to a lot of giggles!

            <details>
                <summary>How will I be able to relax in front of a male photographer?</summary>
                <div>
                    Some women actually prefer male photographer, but we understand if you feel uneasy.
                    What we can promise if relaxed and fun environment (there's chocolate and sparkling wine).
                    Bryson (our photographer) is very professional and knows how to direct posing with ease.
                    The choice of clothing, amount of make-up (we recommend minimal) are entirely up to you!
