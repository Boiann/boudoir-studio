                <br>
                <p>Boudoir Photography experience is a combination of erotic, fashion, portraiture and fine art, a
                    creative
                    way to learn self-love and self-worth.
                    It is primarily intended for the private enjoyment of the subject and their romantic partner.

                <h2>History of Boudoir Photography</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The term "boudoir" comes from the French Language and was primarily attributed to women's dressing
                    rooms.
                    Nude or sexualized female forms have been a theme of photography since as early as 1840.
                    Early erotic photography, such as French postcards from the late 19th and early 20th century, pin-up
                    girls, and Hollywood culture have
                    influenced the visual style of boudoir photography.
                    Notable early artists of the form include Albert Arthur Allen, who photographed larger women against
                    ornate backgrounds.

                <h2>Why should you consider it?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It is common for women to have boudoir photographs of themselves made as a gift to a partner,
                    conventionally on the occasion of their engagement, marriage,
                    or before an enforced separation such as a military deployment.
                    Increasingly, boudoir photography is seen as something that a person might do purely for their own
                    enjoyment, for the pleasure and affirmation of
                    seeing themselves as attractive, daring, sensual, and sexually desirable.</p>
