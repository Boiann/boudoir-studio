            <h2>History of Boudoir Photography</h2>
            <p>The term "boudoir" comes from the French Language and was primarily attributed to women's dressing rooms.
                Nude or sexualized female forms have been a theme of photography since as early as 1840.
                Early erotic photography, such as French postcards from the late 19th and early 20th century, pin-up
                girls, and Hollywood culture have
                influenced the visual style of boudoir photography.
                Notable early artists of the form include Albert Arthur Allen, who photographed larger women against
                ornate backgrounds.

            <h2>Why should you consider it</h2>
            <p>It is common for women to have boudoir photographs of themselves made as a gift to a partner,
                conventionally on the occasion of their engagement, marriage,
                or before an enforced separation such as a military deployment.
                Increasingly, boudoir photography is seen as something that a person might do purely for their own
                enjoyment, for the pleasure and affirmation of
                seeing themselves as attractive, daring, sensual, and sexually desirable.</p>
